A library is a store a of code .

Npm stands for node package manager. It comes preinstalled with node. 

npm enables three things:
 - Reuse our own code in our projects.
 - Reuse code written by other developers in our own projects.
 - Share our own solutions with other developers.

Site is npmjs.com. Can find everything like utilty functions and full blown frameworks and libraries. e.g react has a 'create react app' package hosted on npm.

npm calls a reusable code - a package. It contains javascript code. 

Packages/modules/dependencies all mean the same thing - reusable javascript code in npm.

npm has no quality control. Anyone can create and install anything.

Good indication of secuirity and usefulness is the great amount of weekly downloads/popularity.

npm Packages can be installed in two ways;
- As local dependencies: used only in a particular project. By npm i <packageName>
- As global dependencies: use it in any project. By npm install -g <packageName>

PACKAGE.JSON
Manifest file that stores important information about our project. 

Created in three ways;
A. - Manual approach. Package json is created in the root. 
B. Automatic approach:
 - by running npm init (step by step can press enter to skip).
 - running npm init -y (everything is ste up as default)

Why i do I need package json?
package.json helps to store our dependencies.
